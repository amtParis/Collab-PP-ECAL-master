# Networked Design, Spring 2018

Parsons Paris + ECAL

The goal of this course is to explore the role of networked communications in art and design. Examining precedences such as connected objects, telepresence, the internet of things, smart objects etc. we will consider new ways to incorporate networks and communication over networks into design systems, objects, environments or performances.

This class is a collaboration between students at Parsons Paris and students in ECALâ€™s Media Interaction and Design program in Lausanne, Switzerland.
